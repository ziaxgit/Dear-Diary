List of errors:

- duplicate server

- sql error following tozo sql statements not compatible with sqlite 

- validating request
    - TypeError: Cannot create schema for <class 'app.Card'> - try installing msgspec or pydantic
    - tutorial didnt instruct [pydantic] or [msgspec]
    - careful inspection of pip list showed pydantic was already installed on tutorial

    Solution:
    - installed pip install quart-schema[pydantic]
 
 - not using the keyword "data" and instead using "user"

 - trouble with dynamic route, error with dataclass

- couldnt figure out how to group routes in /docs 
    - found "tagging" in quart_schema docs
